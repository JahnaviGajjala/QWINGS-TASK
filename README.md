# QWINGS-TASK

Q. 1- If x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and y=[5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50], write a python program to predict the values of y for x=15,20, & 30, and also plot the trendline. 

Case-1: Solve the above problem using LinearRegression() inbuilt function.
Case-2: Solve the above problem without using any inbuilt function.



Q.2- If x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and y=[5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50], write a python program to divide this in training and test data (assume 20% of total data will be pushed for test data).

Case-1: Solve the above problem using train_test_split inbuilt function.
Case-2: Solve the above problem without using any inbuilt function.



Q. 3- If x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and y=[5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50], write a python program to find the mean squared error if linear regression model is used to plot the trendline.

Case-1: Solve the above problem using inbuilt function.
Case-2: Solve the above problem without using any inbuilt function.
